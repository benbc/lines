ACT I SCENE I (opening)

RICHARD

Now is the winter of our discontent
Made glorious summer by this sun of York
And all the clouds that loured upon our house
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Grim-visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front -
And now instead of mounting barbed steeds
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
But I that am not shaped for sportive tricks
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass -
Deformed unfinished sent before my time
Into this breathing world scarce half made up -
I am determined to prove a villain
And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
Plots have I laid - inductions dangerous
To set my brother Clarence and the king
In deadly hate the one against the other.
And if King Edward be as true and just
As I am subtle, false and treacherous
This day should Clarence closely be mewed up
About a prophecy which says that "G"
Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
Dive thoughts down to my soul - here Clarence comes.
Brother good day. What means this armed guard
That waits upon your grace?

CLARENCE

This conduct to convey me to the Tower.

RICHARD

Upon what cause?

CLARENCE

        Because my name is George.

RICHARD

Alack my lord that fault is none of yours -
He should for that commit your godfathers.
But what's the matter Clarence may I know?

CLARENCE

It follows in his thought that I am he.

RICHARD

Why this it is when men are ruled by women.
Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower.
My Lady Grey his wife Clarence - tis she
That tempers him to this extremity.
We are not safe Clarence - we are not safe.

CLARENCE

Lord Hastings was to her for his delivery?

RICHARD

Humbly complaining to her deity
Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.
I'll tell you what - I think it is our way
If we will keep in favour with the king
To be her men and wear her livery.

BRAKENBURY

Of what degree soever with your brother.

RICHARD

Even so - an't please your worship Brakenbury
You may partake of any thing we say.
We speak no treason man - we say the king
Is wise and virtuous and his noble queen
Well struck in years, fair and not jealous.
How say you sir? Can you deny all this?

CLARENCE

We know your charge Brakenbury and will obey.

RICHARD

We are the queen's abjects and must obey.
Brother farewell. I will unto the king
And whatsoever you will employ me in -
Were it to call King Edward's widow "sister" -
I will perform it to enfranchise you.
Meantime this deep disgrace in brotherhood
Touches me deeper than you can imagine.

CLARENCE

I know it pleaseth neither of us well.

RICHARD

Well your imprisonment shall not be long -
Meantime have patience.

CLARENCE

        I must perforce. Farewell.

RICHARD

Go tread the path that you shall ne'er return.
Simple, plain Clarence - I do love you so
That I will shortly send your soul to heaven
If heaven will take the present at our hands.
But who comes here - the new-delivered Hastings?

HASTINGS

Good time of day unto my gracious lord.

RICHARD

As much unto my good lord chamberlain.
Well are you welcome to this open air.
How hath your lordship brooked imprisonment?

HASTINGS

That were the cause of my imprisonment.

RICHARD

No doubt no doubt - and so shall Clarence too
For they that were your enemies are his
And have prevailed as much on him as you.
What news abroad?

HASTINGS

And his physicians fear him mightily.

RICHARD

Now by Saint John this news is bad indeed.
O - he hath kept an evil diet long
And overmuch consumed his royal person.
Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
Where is he - in his bed?

HASTINGS

        He is.

RICHARD

Go you before and I will follow you.
He cannot live I hope and must not die
Till George be packed with post-horse up to heaven.
And if I fail not in my deep intent
Clarence hath not another day to live -
Which done God take King Edward to his mercy
And leave the world for me to bustle in.
For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.
What - though I killed her husband and her father?
The readiest way to make the wench amends
Is to become her husband and her father -
The which will I not all so much for love
As for another secret close intent
By marrying her which I must reach unto.
But yet I run before my horse to market -
Clarence still breathes, Edward still lives and reigns.
When they are gone then must I count my gains.

ACT I SCENE II (seduction)

LADY ANNE

For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell.

RICHARD

Lady you know no rules of charity
Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.

LADY ANNE

No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.

RICHARD

But I know none and therefore am no beast.

LADY ANNE

O wonderful - when devils tell the truth.

RICHARD

More wonderful when angels are so angry.
Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,
Of these supposed crimes to give me leave
By circumstance but to acquit myself.
I did not kill your husband.

LADY ANNE

Why, then he is alive.

RICHARD

Nay he is dead and slain by Edward's hands.

LADY ANNE

Did you not kill this king?

RICHARD

        I grant you.

LADY ANNE

O - he was gentle, mild, and virtuous.

RICHARD

The fitter for the King of heaven that hath him.

LADY ANNE

He is in heaven where you shall never come.

RICHARD

Let him thank me that holp to send him thither
For he was fitter for that place than earth.

LADY ANNE

And you unfit for any place but hell.

RICHARD

Yes one place else if you will hear me name it.

LADY ANNE

Some dungeon.

RICHARD

        Your bedchamber.

LADY ANNE

Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest.

RICHARD

So will it madam till I lie with you.

LADY ANNE

Black night o'ershade thy day and death thy life.

RICHARD

Curse not yourself fair creature - you are both.

LADY ANNE

I would I were to be revenged on thee.

RICHARD

It is a quarrel most unnatural
To be revenged on him that loveth thee.

LADY ANNE

To be revenged on him that killed my husband.

RICHARD

He that bereft you lady of your husband
Did it to help you to a better husband.

LADY ANNE

His better does not breathe upon the earth.

RICHARD

He lives that loves you better than he could.

LADY ANNE

Name him.

RICHARD

        Plantagenet.

LADY ANNE

                Why that was he.

RICHARD

The selfsame name but one of better nature.

LADY ANNE

Where is he?

RICHARD

        Here. Why do you spit at me?

LADY ANNE

Would it were mortal poison for your sake.

RICHARD

Never came poison from so sweet a place.

LADY ANNE

Out of my sight. Thou dost infect my eyes.

RICHARD

Your eyes sweet lady have infected mine.

LADY ANNE

Would they were basilisks to strike thee dead.

RICHARD

I would they were that I might die at once -
For now they kill me with a living death.
Teach not your lip such scorn for it was made
For kissing lady not for such contempt.
Lo - here I lend you this sharp-pointed sword -
Which if you please to hide in this true breast
And let the soul forth that adoreth thee -
I lay it naked to the deadly stroke
And humbly beg the death upon my knee.
Nay do not pause for I did kill King Henry
But twas your beauty that provoked me.
Nay now dispatch - twas I that stabbed young Edward
But twas your heavenly face that set me on.

LADY ANNE

I will not be your executioner.

RICHARD

Then bid me kill myself and I will do it.

LADY ANNE

I have already.

RICHARD

        That was in your rage.
Speak it again and even with the word
This hand which for your love did kill your love
Shall for your love kill a far truer love -
To both their deaths shalt thou be accessary.

LADY ANNE

I would I knew your heart.

RICHARD

Tis figured in my tongue.

LADY ANNE

I fear me both are false.

RICHARD

Then never man was true.

LADY ANNE

Well well - put up your sword.

RICHARD

Say then my peace is made.

LADY ANNE

That shall you know hereafter.

RICHARD

But shall I live in hope?

LADY ANNE

All men I hope live so.

RICHARD

Vouchsafe to wear this ring.

LADY ANNE

To take is not to give.

RICHARD

Look how this ring encompasseth thy finger -
Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart.
And if thy poor devoted servant may
But beg one favour at thy gracious hand
Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.

LADY ANNE

What is it?

RICHARD

That it would please thee leave these sad designs
To him that hath most cause to be a mourner
And presently repair to Crosby House
Where after I have solemnly interred
At Chertsey monastery this noble king
And wet his grave with my repentant tears
I will with all expedient duty see you.
Grant me this boon.

LADY ANNE

Tressel and Berkeley - go along with me.

RICHARD

Bid me farewell.

LADY ANNE

Imagine I have said farewell already.

RICHARD

Was ever woman in this humour wooed?
Was ever woman in this humour won?
I'll have her but I will not keep her long.
What, I that killed her husband and his father -
To take her in her heart's extremest hate
With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,
The bleeding witness of her hatred by -
Having God, her conscience and these bars against me
And I nothing to back my suit at all
But the plain devil and dissembling looks?
And yet to win her - all the world to nothing.
Ha.
Upon my life she finds although I cannot
Myself to be a marvellous proper man.
Shine out fair sun till I have bought a glass
That I may see my shadow as I pass.

ACT I SCENE III (Margaret's curses)

BUCKINGHAM

And sent to warn them to his royal presence.

RICHARD

They do me wrong and I will not endure it.
Who are they that complain unto the king
That I, forsooth, am stern and love them not?
Because I cannot flatter and look fair,
Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog -
I must be held a rancorous enemy.
Cannot a plain man live and think no harm
But thus his simple truth must be abused
By silken, sly, insinuating jacks?

RIVERS

To who in all this presence speaks your grace?

RICHARD

To thee that hast nor honesty nor grace.
When have I injured thee? When done thee wrong?
- or thee? - or thee? - or any of your faction?
A plague upon you all. His royal grace
Whom God preserve better than you would wish
Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing while
But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.

QUEEN MARGARET

Thy honour, state and seat is due to me.

RICHARD

What - threat you me with telling of the king?
Tell him and spare not. Look - what I have said
I will avouch it in presence of the king.
Tis time to speak - my pains are quite forgot.

QUEEN MARGARET

And Edward my poor son at Tewksbury.

RICHARD

Ere you were queen - ay - or your husband king
I was a packhorse in his great affairs.
To royalise his blood I spent mine own.

QUEEN MARGARET

Ay - and much better blood than his or thine.

RICHARD

In all which time you and your husband Grey
Were factious for the house of Lancaster.
Let me put in your minds if you forget
What you have been ere now and what you are -
Withal what I have been and what I am.

QUEEN MARGARET

A murderous villain and so still thou art.

RICHARD

Poor Clarence did forsake his father Warwick
Ay and forswore himself - which Jesu pardon -

QUEEN MARGARET

Which God revenge.

RICHARD

To fight on Edward's party for the crown
And for his meed poor lord he is mewed up.
I would to God my heart were flint like Edward's
Or Edward's soft and pitiful like mine.
I am too childish-foolish for this world.

RIVERS

So should we you if you should be our king.

RICHARD

If I should be? I had rather be a pedlar.
Far be it from my heart the thought thereof.

QUEEN MARGARET

Ah - gentle villain do not turn away.

RICHARD

Foul wrinkled witch what makest thou in my sight?

QUEEN MARGARET

But by some unlooked accident cut off.

RICHARD

Have done thy charm thou hateful withered hag.

QUEEN MARGARET

Thou rag of honour - thou detested

RICHARD

        Margaret.

QUEEN MARGARET

Richard.

RICHARD

        Ha?

QUEEN MARGARET

            I call thee not.

RICHARD

I cry thee mercy then for I did think
That thou hadst called me all these bitter names.

QUEEN MARGARET

O - let me make the period to my curse.

RICHARD

Tis done by me and ends in "Margaret".

QUEEN MARGARET

And if they fall they dash themselves to pieces.

RICHARD

Good counsel marry. Learn it - learn it marquess.

DORSET

It toucheth you, my lord, as much as me.

RICHARD

Yea and much more - but I was born so high.
Our aerie buildeth in the cedar's top
And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun.

QUEEN MARGARET

And all their ministers attend on him.

RICHARD

What doth she say my Lord of Buckingham?

HASTINGS

My hair doth stand on end to hear her curses.

RICHARD

I cannot blame her - by God's holy mother
She hath had too much wrong and I repent
My part thereof that I have done to her.

QUEEN ELIZABETH

I never did her any to my knowledge.

RICHARD

Yet you have all the vantage of her wrong.

RIVERS

To pray for them that have done scathe to us.

RICHARD

So do I ever. (Being well advised -
For had I cursed now I had cursed myself.)

RIVERS

We wait upon your grace.

RICHARD

I do the wrong and first begin to brawl.
Clarence who I indeed have cast in darkness
I do beweep to many simple gulls -
Namely to Derby, Hastings, Buckingham -
And tell them tis the queen and her allies
That stir the king against the duke my brother.
Now they believe it and withal whet me
To be revenged on Rivers, Dorset, Grey.
But then I sigh and with a piece of scripture
Tell them that God bids us do good for evil -
And thus I clothe my naked villainy
With odd old ends stolen out of holy writ
And seem a saint when most I play the devil.
But soft - here come my executioners.
How now my hardy, stout resolved mates -
Are you now going to dispatch this thing?

TYRREL

That we may be admitted where he is.

RICHARD

Well thought upon. I have it here about me.
But sirs be sudden in the execution -
Withal obdurate - do not hear him plead.

TYRREL

We go to use our hands and not our tongues.

RICHARD

Your eyes drop millstones when fools' eyes drop tears.
I like you lads. About your business straight.
Go go - dispatch.

ACT II SCENE I (Edward)

BUCKINGHAM

And in good time here comes the noble duke.

RICHARD

Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen
And princely peers - a happy time of day.

KING EDWARD IV

Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.

RICHARD

A blessed labour my most sovereign lord.
Amongst this princely heap - if any here
By false intelligence or wrong surmise
Hold me a foe -
I hate it and desire all good men's love.
First madam, I entreat true peace of you -
Of you my noble cousin Buckingham -
Of you Lord Rivers and Lord Grey of you.
I do not know that Englishman alive
With whom my soul is any jot at odds
More than the infant that is born tonight.
I thank my God for my humility.

QUEEN ELIZABETH

To take our brother Clarence to your grace.

RICHARD

Why madam - have I offered love for this
To be so flouted in this royal presence?
Who knows not that the gentle duke is dead?
You do him injury to scorn his corse.

KING EDWARD IV

Is Clarence dead? The order was reversed.

RICHARD

But he poor man by your first order died
And that a winged Mercury did bear -
Some tardy cripple bore the countermand
That came too lag to see him buried.
Come Hastings - help me to my closet.
Oh - poor Clarence.
This is the fruits of rashness. Marked you not
How that the guilty kindred of the queen
Looked pale when they did hear of Clarence's death?
O - they did urge it still unto the king.
God will revenge it. Come lords will you go
To comfort Edward with our company?

ACT II SCENE II (after Edward's death)

DORSET

Let him be crowned. In him your comfort lives.

RICHARD

Sister have comfort. All of us have cause
To wail the dimming of our shining star
But none can help our harms by wailing them.
Madam my mother - I do cry you mercy -
I did not see your grace. Humbly on my knee
I crave your blessing.

DUCHESS OF YORK

Love, charity, obedience and true duty.

RICHARD

Amen. (And make me die a good old man -
That is the butt-end of a mother's blessing -
I marvel that her grace did leave it out.)

BUCKINGHAM

Hither to London to be crowned our king.

RICHARD

Then be it so and go we to determine
Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow.

BUCKINGHAM

To part the queen's proud kindred from the prince.

RICHARD

My other self, my counsel's consistory,
My oracle, my prophet, my dear cousin -
I like a child will go by thy direction.
Towards Ludlow then for we'll not stay behind.

ACT III SCENE I (welcome princes)

BUCKINGHAM

Welcome sweet prince to London - to your chamber.

RICHARD

Welcome dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign -
The weary way has made you melancholy.

PRINCE EDWARD

I want more uncles here to welcome me.

RICHARD

Sweet prince - the untainted virtue of your years
Has not yet dived into the world's deceit.
Those uncles which you want were dangerous -
Your grace attended to their sugared words
But looked not on the poison of their hearts.
God keep you from them and from such false friends.

PRINCE EDWARD

God keep me from false friends but they were none.

RICHARD

My lord the mayor of London comes to greet you.

PRINCE EDWARD

Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?

RICHARD

Where it seems best unto your royal self.
If I may counsel you some day or two
Your highness shall repose you at the Tower -
Then where you please and shall be thought most fit
For your best health and recreation.

PRINCE EDWARD

Even to the general all-ending day.

RICHARD

(So wise so young they say do never live long.)

PRINCE EDWARD

What say you uncle?

RICHARD

I say - without characters fame lives long.

PRINCE EDWARD

Or die a soldier as I lived a king.

RICHARD

(Short summers lightly have a forward spring.)

PRINCE RICHARD

Well my dread lord - so must I call you now.

RICHARD

How fares our cousin noble Lord of York?

PRINCE RICHARD

I pray you uncle give me this dagger.

RICHARD

My dagger little cousin? With all my heart.

PRINCE RICHARD

Of my kind uncle that I know will give.

RICHARD

A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.
What - would you have my weapon little lord?

PRINCE RICHARD

I would that I might thank you as you call me.

RICHARD

How?

PRINCE RICHARD

    Little.

RICHARD

            My lord willt please you pass along?
Myself and my good cousin Buckingham
Will to your mother to entreat of her
To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.

PRINCE RICHARD

I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.

RICHARD

Why - what should you fear?

PRINCE EDWARD

I fear no uncles dead.

RICHARD

Nor none that live I hope.

BUCKINGHAM

To sit about the coronation.

RICHARD

Commend me to Lord Hastings. Tell him Catesby
His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries
Tomorrow are let blood at Pomfret Castle.

BUCKINGHAM

Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?

RICHARD

Chop off his head - something we will determine.
And look when I am king claim thou of me
The earldom of Hereford and all the moveables
Whereof the king my brother was possessed.

BUCKINGHAM

I'll claim that promise at your grace's hand.

RICHARD

And look to have it yielded with all kindness.
Come let us sup betimes - that afterwards
We may digest our complots in some form.

ACT III SCENE IV (condemn Hastings)

LORD MAYOR

In happy time here comes the duke himself.

RICHARD

My noble lords and cousins all good morrow.
I have been long a sleeper but I trust
My absence doth neglect no great design
Which by my presence might have been concluded.

BUCKINGHAM

I mean your voice - for crowning of the king.

RICHARD

Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder -
His lordship knows me well and loves me well.
Lord Mayor when that I was last in Holborn
I saw good strawberries in your garden there
I do beseech you send for some of them.

LORD MAYOR

Marry and will my lord with all my heart.

RICHARD

Cousin of Buckingham a word with you.
Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business
And finds the testy gentleman so hot
That he will lose his head ere give consent
His master's child, as worshipfully he terms it,
Shall lose the royalty of England's throne.

DERBY

I pray God he be not I say.

RICHARD

I pray you all, - tell me what they deserve
That do conspire my death with devilish plots
Of damned witchcraft and that have prevailed
Upon my body with their hellish charms?

HASTINGS

I say my lord they have deserved death.

RICHARD

Then be your eyes the witness of their evil.
Look how I am bewitched. Behold mine arm
Is like a blasted sapling withered up -
And this is Edward's wife that monstrous witch
Together with your mistress strumpet Shore
That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.

HASTINGS

If they have done this thing my gracious lord -

RICHARD

If? Thou protector of this damned strumpet
Talk you to me of "ifs"? You are a traitor.
Off with his head. Now by Saint Paul I swear
I will not dine until I see the same.
Catesby look that it be done.
The rest that love me - rise and follow me.

ACT III SCENE V (Hastings' head)

RICHARD

Come cousin - canst thou quake and change thy colour,
Murder thy breath in the middle of a word
And then begin again and stop again -
As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror?

BUCKINGHAM

At any time to grace my stratagems.
Lord Mayor -

RICHARD

Look to the drawbridge there!

BUCKINGHAM

Lord mayor the reason we have sent -

RICHARD

Look back! Defend thee! Here are enemies.

BUCKINGHAM

God and our innocency defend and guard us.

RICHARD

Be patient it is a friend - Sir William Catesby.

CATESBY

The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.

RICHARD

So dear I loved the man that I must weep.
I took him for the plainest harmless creature
That breathed upon the earth a Christian.

LORD MAYOR

Had he done so?

RICHARD

Think you we would against the form of law
Proceed thus rashly in the villain's death
But that the extreme peril of the case
Enforced us to this execution?

LORD MAYOR

With all your just proceedings in this cause.

RICHARD

And to that end we wished your lordship here
To avoid the censures of the carping world.

BUCKINGHAM

And so my good lord mayor we bid farewell.

RICHARD

Go after, after cousin Buckingham.
The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post.
There at your meetest advantage of the time
Infer the bastardy of Edward's children.
Moreover urge his hateful luxury
And bestial appetite in change of lust
Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives -
Even where his raging eye or savage heart
Without control lusted to make a prey.
Nay - for a need thus far come near my person -
Tell them when that my mother went with child
Of that insatiate Edward, noble York
My princely father then had wars in France
And by true computation of the time
Found that the issue was not his begot.
Yet touch this sparingly as twere far off
Because my lord you know my mother lives.

BUCKINGHAM

Were for myself. And so my lord adieu.

RICHARD

If you thrive well bring them to Baynard's Castle
Where you shall find me well accompanied
With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops.

BUCKINGHAM

Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.

RICHARD

Go Catesby.
Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle.
Now will I in to take some privy order
And to give notice that no manner person
Have any time recourse unto the princes.

ACT III SCENE VI (accept crown)

RICHARD

How now, how now - what say the citizens?

BUCKINGHAM

The citizens are mum, say not a word.

RICHARD

Touched you the bastardy of Edward's children?

BUCKINGHAM

Cry "God save Richard England's royal king."

RICHARD

And did they so?

BUCKINGHAM

Argues your wisdom and your love to Richard."

RICHARD

What tongueless blocks were they. Would not they speak?
Will not the mayor then and his brethren come?

BUCKINGHAM

Play the maid's part - still answer nay and take it.

RICHARD

I go and if you plead as well for them
As I can say nay to thee for myself
No doubt we'll bring it to a happy issue.

BUCKINGHAM

Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.

RICHARD

My lord there needs no such apology.
I rather do beseech you pardon me
Who earnest in the service of my God
Neglect the visitation of my friends.
But leaving this what is your grace's pleasure?

BUCKINGHAM

And all good men of this ungoverned isle.

RICHARD

I do suspect I have done some offence
That seems disgracious in the city's eye
And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.

BUCKINGHAM

At our entreaties to amend your fault.

RICHARD

Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?

BUCKINGHAM

And kingly government of this your land.

RICHARD

I know not whether to depart in silence
Or bitterly to speak in your reproof.
Your love deserves my thanks but my desert
Unmeritable shuns your high request.
The royal tree hath left us royal fruit
Which mellowed by the stealing hours of time
Will well become the seat of majesty
And make no doubt us happy by his reign.

CATESBY

O make them joyful - grant their lawful suit.

RICHARD

Alas why would you heap this care on me?
I am unfit for state and majesty.
I do beseech you take it not amiss -
I cannot nor I will not yield to you.

BUCKINGHAM

And in this resolution here we leave you.

RICHARD

O do not swear my lord of Buckingham.

CATESBY

If you deny them all the land will rue it.

RICHARD

Would you enforce me to a world of cares?
Call him again. I am not made of stones
But penetrable to your kind entreaties -
Albeit against my conscience and my soul.
Cousin of Buckingham, you sage, grave men
Since you will buckle fortune on my back
To bear her burden whether I will or no
I must have patience to endure the load.
For God doth know and you may partly see
How far I am from the desire of this.

LORD MAYOR

God bless your grace - we see it and will say it.

RICHARD

In saying so you shall but say the truth.

BUCKINGHAM

Tomorrow may it please you to be crowned?

RICHARD

Even when you please - for you will have it so.

BUCKINGHAM

And so most joyfully we take our leave.

RICHARD

Come let us to our holy work again.
Farewell my cousin, farewell gentle friends.

ACT IV SCENE II (after coronation)

RICHARD

Stand all apart - Cousin of Buckingham.

BUCKINGHAM

My gracious sovereign?

RICHARD

Give me your hand. Thus high by your advice
And your assistance is King Richard seated.
But shall we wear these glories for a day?
Or shall they last and we rejoice in them?

BUCKINGHAM

Still live they and for ever let them last.

RICHARD

O Buckingham - now do I play the touch
To try if you be current gold indeed.
Young Edward lives - think now what I would speak.

BUCKINGHAM

Say on my loving lord.

RICHARD

Why Buckingham - I say I would be king,

BUCKINGHAM

Why so you are my thrice-renowned lord.

RICHARD

Ha. Am I king? Tis so - but Edward lives.

BUCKINGHAM

True noble prince.

RICHARD

Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead
And I would have it suddenly performed.
What sayest thou now? Speak suddenly. Be brief.

BUCKINGHAM

Your grace may do your pleasure.

RICHARD

Tut tut thou art all ice - thy kindness freezes.
Say have I your consent that they shall die?

BUCKINGHAM

I will resolve you herein presently.

RICHARD

High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect.
Catesby!

CATESBY

My lord?

RICHARD

Know you not any whom corrupting gold
Would tempt unto a close exploit of death?

CATESBY

And will no doubt tempt him to any thing.

RICHARD

What is his name?

CATESBY

        His name my lord is Tyrrel.

RICHARD

I partly know the man. Go call him hither.
The deep-revolving, witty Buckingham
No more shall be the neighbour to my counsels.
Hath he so long held out with me untired
And stops he now for breath? Well be it so.
How now my Lord of Derby - what's the news?

DERBY

To Tudor in the place where he abides.

RICHARD

Come hither Catesby. Rumour it abroad
That Anne my wife is very grievous sick.
I will take order for her keeping close.
About it - for it stands me much upon
To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.
I must be married to my brother's daughter
Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.
Murder her brothers and then marry her -
Uncertain way of gain. But I am in
So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin.
Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.
Is thy name Tyrrel?

TYRREL

James Tyrrel and your most obedient subject.

RICHARD

Are you indeed?

TYRREL

        Prove me my gracious lord.

RICHARD

Dare you resolve to kill a friend of mine?

TYRREL

Please you. But I had rather kill two enemies.

RICHARD

Why then you have it. Two deep enemies,
Foes to my rest and my sweet sleep's disturbers
Are they that I would have you deal upon.
Tyrrel I mean those bastards in the Tower.

TYRREL

And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them.

RICHARD

You sing sweet music. Hark - come hither Tyrrel
Go by this token. Rise and lend your ear -
There is no more but so. Say it is done
And I will love you and prefer you for it.

BUCKINGHAM

The late demand that you did sound me in.

RICHARD

Well let that rest. Dorset is fled to Tudor.

BUCKINGHAM

I hear the news my lord.

RICHARD

Derby he is your wife's son. Well - look unto it.

BUCKINGHAM

Which you have promised I shall possess.

RICHARD

Derby look to your wife - if she convey
Letters to Tudor you shall answer it.

BUCKINGHAM

What says your highness to my just request?

RICHARD

I do remember me - Henry the Sixth
Did prophesy that Tudor should be king
When Tudor was a little peevish boy.
A king - perhaps -

BUCKINGHAM

        My lord.

RICHARD

How chance the prophet could not at that time
Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?

BUCKINGHAM

My lord your promise for the earldom -

RICHARD

Ay - what's o'clock?

BUCKINGHAM

Of what you promised me.

RICHARD

Well - but what's o'clock?

BUCKINGHAM

Upon the stroke of ten.

RICHARD

Well - let it strike.

BUCKINGHAM

Why let it strike?

RICHARD

Because that like a jack you keep the stroke
Betwixt your begging and my meditation.
I am not in the giving vein today.

BUCKINGHAM

May it please you to resolve me in my suit?

RICHARD

You trouble me. I am not in the vein.

ACT IV SCENE III (after murder of princes)

TYRREL

And here he comes. All health my sovereign lord.

RICHARD

Kind Tyrrel am I happy in thy news?

TYRREL

Beget your happiness - be happy then
For it is done.

RICHARD

        But did you see them dead?

TYRREL

I did my lord.

RICHARD

And buried gentle Tyrrel?

TYRREL

But where to say the truth I do not know.

RICHARD

Come to me Tyrrel soon at after-supper
And you shall tell the process of their death.
Meantime but think how I may do you good
And be inheritor of your desire.
Farewell till soon.

TYRREL

        I humbly take my leave.

RICHARD

The son of Clarence have I pent up close,
His daughter meanly have I matched in marriage,
The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom
And Anne my wife hath bid this world good night.
Now - for I know the Breton Tudor aims
At young Elizabeth my brother's daughter
And by that knot looks proudly on the crown -
To her I go a jolly thriving wooer.

CATESBY

My lord.

RICHARD

Good or bad news that you come in so bluntly?

CATESBY

Is in the field and still his power increaseth.

RICHARD

Go muster men. My counsel is my shield.
We must be brief when traitors brave the field.

ACT IV SCENE IV (waylaid by women)

DUCHESS OF YORK

The trumpet sounds. Be copious in exclaims.

RICHARD

Who intercepts me in my expedition?

QUEEN ELIZABETH

Where is kind Hastings? Where are Rivers, Grey?

RICHARD

A flourish - trumpets - strike alarum - drums!
Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women
Rail on the Lord's anointed. Strike I say.
Either be patient and entreat me fair
Or with the clamorous report of war
Thus will I drown your exclamations.

DUCHESS OF YORK

Art thou my son?

RICHARD

Ay - I thank God, my father, and yourself.

DUCHESS OF YORK

Then patiently hear my impatience.

RICHARD

Madam I have a touch of your condition
Which cannot brook the accent of reproof.

DUCHESS OF YORK

O let me speak.

RICHARD

        Do then - but I'll not hear.

DUCHESS OF YORK

I will be mild and gentle in my words.

RICHARD

And brief good mother for I am in haste.

DUCHESS OF YORK

God knows - in torment and in agony.

RICHARD

And came I not at last to comfort you?

DUCHESS OF YORK

You came on earth to make the earth my hell.

RICHARD

Strike up the drum.

DUCHESS OF YORK

        I prithee hear me speak.

RICHARD

You speak too bitterly.

DUCHESS OF YORK

For I shall never speak to thee again.

RICHARD

So.

QUEEN ELIZABETH

Abides in me. I say amen to her.

RICHARD

Stay madam I must talk a word with you.

QUEEN ELIZABETH

And therefore level not to hit their lives.

RICHARD

You have a daughter called Elizabeth -
Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.

QUEEN ELIZABETH

I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.

RICHARD

Wrong not her birth. She is a royal princess.

QUEEN ELIZABETH

To save her life I'll say she is not so.

RICHARD

Her life is safest only in her birth.

QUEEN ELIZABETH

And only in that safety died her brothers.

RICHARD

Lo - at their births good stars were opposite.

QUEEN ELIZABETH

No - to their lives ill friends were contrary.

RICHARD

All unavoided is the doom of destiny.

QUEEN ELIZABETH

If grace had blessed you with a fairer life.

RICHARD

Madam so thrive I in my enterprise
And dangerous success of bloody wars
As I intend more good to you and yours
Than ever you or yours by me were harmed.

QUEEN ELIZABETH

Can you demise to any child of mine?

RICHARD

Even all I have - ay and myself and all -
Will I withal endow a child of thine.

QUEEN ELIZABETH

Last longer telling than your kindness' date.

RICHARD

Then know that from my soul I love your daughter.

QUEEN ELIZABETH

My daughter's mother thinks it with her soul.

RICHARD

What do you think?

QUEEN ELIZABETH

And from my heart's love I do thank you for it.

RICHARD

Be not so hasty to confound my meaning -
I mean that with my soul I love your daughter
And do intend to make her queen of England.

QUEEN ELIZABETH

Well then who do you mean shall be her king?

RICHARD

Even he that makes her queen. Who else should be?

QUEEN ELIZABETH

What you?

RICHARD

        Even so. How think you of it?

QUEEN ELIZABETH

How can you woo her?

RICHARD

        That would I learn of you
As one being best acquainted with her humour.

QUEEN ELIZABETH

And will you learn of me?

RICHARD

        With all my heart.

QUEEN ELIZABETH

Made quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.

RICHARD

You mock me madam. This is not the way
To win your daughter.

QUEEN ELIZABETH

And not be Richard that has done all this.

RICHARD

Say that I did all this for love of her.

QUEEN ELIZABETH

Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.

RICHARD

Look what is done cannot be now amended.
If I did take the kingdom from your sons
To make amends I'll give it to your daughter.
Go then my mother - to thy daughter go.
Make bold her bashful years with your experience.
And when this arm of mine hath chastised
The petty rebel dull-brained Buckingham
Bound with triumphant garlands will I come
And lead your daughter to a conqueror's bed.

QUEEN ELIZABETH

Or he that slew her brothers and her uncles?

RICHARD

Say I will love her everlastingly.

QUEEN ELIZABETH

But how long fairly shall her sweet life last?

RICHARD

As long as heaven and nature lengthens it.

QUEEN ELIZABETH

As long as hell and Richard likes of it.

RICHARD

Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.

QUEEN ELIZABETH

Too deep and dead - poor infants in their grave.

RICHARD

Harp not on that string madam - that is past.

QUEEN ELIZABETH

Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break.

RICHARD

Now by my George, my garter and my crown -

QUEEN ELIZABETH

Profaned, dishonoured and the third usurped.

RICHARD

I swear -

QUEEN ELIZABETH

Swear then by something that you have not wronged.

RICHARD

Now by the world -

QUEEN ELIZABETH

        Tis full of your foul wrongs.

RICHARD

My father's death -

QUEEN ELIZABETH

        Thy life has it dishonoured.

RICHARD

Then by myself -

QUEEN ELIZABETH

        Yourself is self-misused.

RICHARD

Why then by God.

QUEEN ELIZABETH

What can you swear by now?

RICHARD

        The time to come.

QUEEN ELIZABETH

Misused ere used by times ill-used o'erpast.

RICHARD

Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours -
Day yield me not thy light - nor night thy rest -
Be opposite all planets of good luck
To my proceedings - if with pure heart's love,
Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,
I tender not your beauteous princely daughter.
In her consists my happiness and thine -
Without her follows to myself and thee
Death, desolation, ruin and decay.
It cannot be avoided but by this -
It will not be avoided but by this.

QUEEN ELIZABETH

Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?

RICHARD

Ay if the devil tempt you to do good.

QUEEN ELIZABETH

Yet you did kill my children.

RICHARD

But in your daughter's womb I bury them
Where in that nest of spicery they will breed
Selves of themselves to your recomforture.

QUEEN ELIZABETH

Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?

RICHARD

And be a happy mother by the deed.

QUEEN ELIZABETH

And you shall understand from me her mind.

RICHARD

Bear her my true love's kiss - and so farewell.
Relenting fool and shallow, changing woman.
How now - what news?

CATESBY

Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.

RICHARD

Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of Norfolk.
Fly to the duke and post thou to Salisbury.
Why stay you here and go not to the duke?

CATESBY

What from your grace I shall deliver to him.

RICHARD

O true good Catesby. Bid him levy straight
The greatest strength and power that he can make
And meet me presently at Salisbury.

CATESBY

What may it please you I shall do at Salisbury?

RICHARD

Why what would you do there before I go?

CATESBY

Your highness told me I should post before.

RICHARD

My mind is changed. Derby what news with you?

DERBY

Nor none so bad but well may be reported.

RICHARD

Once more what news?

DERBY

        Tudor is on the seas.

RICHARD

There let him sink and be the seas on him -
White-livered runagate. What does he there?

DERBY

I know not mighty sovereign but by guess.

RICHARD

Well - as you guess?

DERBY

He makes for England here to claim the crown.

RICHARD

Is the chair empty? Is the sword unswayed?
Is the king dead? The empire unpossessed?
What heir of York is there alive but we?
Then tell me - what makes he upon the seas?

DERBY

Unless for that my liege I cannot guess.

RICHARD

Unless for that he comes to be your liege
You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes.
You will revolt and fly to him I fear.

DERBY

No my good lord - therefore mistrust me not.

RICHARD

Where is your power then to beat him back?
Where be your tenants and your followers?
Are they not now upon the western shore
Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships?

DERBY

No my good lord my friends are in the north.

RICHARD

Cold friends to me. What do they in the north
When they should serve their sovereign in the west?

DERBY

Where and what time your majesty shall please.

RICHARD

Ay - you would be gone to join with Tudor
But I'll not trust you.

DERBY

I never was nor never will be false.

RICHARD

Go then and muster men but leave behind
Your son George Stanley. Look your heart be firm
Or else his head's assurance is but frail.

MESSENGER

My lord the army of the Duke of Buckingham -

RICHARD

Out on you owls! Nothing but songs of death?
There - take thou that till thou bring better news.

MESSENGER

No man knows whither.

RICHARD

        I cry you mercy.
There is my purse to cure that blow of thine.
Hath any well-advised friend proclaimed
Reward to him that brings the traitor in?

TYRREL

Hoisted sail and made again for Brittany.

RICHARD

March on march on - since we are up in arms -
If not to fight with foreign enemies
Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.

CATESBY

Is colder tidings yet they must be told.

RICHARD

Away towards Salisbury! While we reason here
A royal battle might be won and lost.
Someone take order Buckingham be brought
To Salisbury. The rest march on with me.

ACT V SCENE III (arrival at Bosworth)

RICHARD

Here pitch our tents - even here in Bosworth field.
Sir William Catesby -

CATESBY

        Here, most gracious liege.

RICHARD

Catesby we must have knocks ha - must we not?

CATESBY

We must both give and take my loving lord.

RICHARD

Up with my tent. Here will I lie tonight
But where tomorrow? Well all's one for that.
Who hath descried the number of the traitors?

CATESBY

Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.

RICHARD

Why our battalion trebles that account.
Up with the tent! Come noble gentlemen
Let us survey the vantage of the ground.
Let's lack no discipline, make no delay -
For lords tomorrow is a busy day.

DORSET

And so God give you quiet rest tonight.

RICHARD

What is't o'clock?

CATESBY

It's supper time, my lord - it's nine o'clock.

RICHARD

I will not sup tonight. Give me some ink and paper.
Is all my armour laid into my tent?

CATESBY

It is my liege and all things are in readiness.

RICHARD

Send out a pursuivant at arms
To Derby's regiment. Bid him bring his power
Before sunrising lest his son George fall
Into the blind cave of eternal night.
Fill me a bowl of wine. Give me a watch.
Look that my staves be sound and not too heavy.
Catesby -

CATESBY

My lord?

RICHARD

Saw you the melancholy Lord Northumberland?

CATESBY

Went through the army cheering up the soldiers.

RICHARD

So I am satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine.
I have not that alacrity of spirit
Nor cheer of mind that I was wont to have.
Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?

CATESBY

It is my lord.

RICHARD

Bid my guard watch. Leave me.
Catesby about the mid of night come to my tent
And help to arm me. Leave me I say.

BUCKINGHAM

And Richard fall in height of all his pride.

RICHARD

Give me another horse! Bind up my wounds!
Have mercy Jesu - soft I did but dream.
The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight.
Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.
What do I fear? Myself? There's none else by.
Is there a murderer here? No. Yes - I am.
My conscience hath a thousand several tongues
And every tongue brings in a several tale
And every tale condemns me for a villain.
Methought the souls of all that I had murdered
Came to my tent and every one did threat
Tomorrow's vengeance on the head of Richard.

CATESBY

My lord.

RICHARD

        Zounds who is there?

CATESBY

Your friends are up and buckle on their armour.

RICHARD

O Catesby I have dreamed a fearful dream.
What thinkest thou will our friends prove all true?

CATESBY

No doubt my lord.

RICHARD

        O Catesby - I fear, I fear -

CATESBY

Nay good my lord be not afraid of shadows.

RICHARD

By the apostle Paul - shadows tonight
Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard
Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers
Armed in proof and led by shallow Tudor.
Tis not yet near day. Come go with me.

TUDOR

God and Saint George, Tudor and victory!

RICHARD

What said Northumberland as touching Tudor?

CATESBY

That he was never trained up in arms.

RICHARD

He said the truth and so indeed it is.
Tell the clock there. Give me a calendar.
Who saw the sun today?

CATESBY

        Not I my lord.

RICHARD

Then he disdains to shine for by the book
He should have braved the east an hour ago.
A black day will it be to somebody.
Catesby!

CATESBY

My lord.

RICHARD

        The sun will not be seen to-day.
The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.
Not shine today? Why - what is that to me
More than to Tudor? For the selfsame heaven
That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.

MESSENGER

Arm arm my lord - the foe vaunts in the field.

RICHARD

Come - bustle bustle. Caparison my horse.
Call up Lord Derby - bid him bring his power.
I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain
And thus my battle shall be ordered -
My foreward shall be drawn out all in lengt,
Consisting equally of horse and foot -
Our archers shall be placed in the midst.
This and Saint George to boot. What think you Catesby?

CATESBY

A good direction warlike sovereign.

RICHARD

Go gentlemen - every man unto his charge.
March on - join bravely - let us to it pell-mell -
If not to heaven then hand in hand to hell.
Remember whom you are to cope withal -
A sort of vagabonds, rascals and runaways
Whom their o'ercloyed country vomits forth
To desperate ventures and assured destruction.
And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow?
Let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again -
Lash hence these overweening rags of France.
Shall these enjoy our lands? Lie with our wives?
Ravish our daughters? Hark - I hear their drum.
Fight gentlemen of England. Fight bold yeomen.
Draw archers, draw your arrows to the head.
What says Lord Derby - will he bring his power?

MESSENGER

My lord he doth deny to come.

RICHARD

Off with his son George's head.

CATESBY

After the battle let George Stanley die.

RICHARD

A thousand hearts are great within my bosom.
Advance our standards. Set upon our foes.
Our ancient word of courage fair Saint George
Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons.
Upon them - victory sits on our helms.

ACT V SCENE IV (the battle)

CATESBY

Rescue fair lords or else the day is lost.

RICHARD

A horse, a horse - my kingdom for a horse.

CATESBY

Withdraw my lord. I'll help you to a horse.

RICHARD

Slave I have set my life upon a cast
And I will stand the hazard of the die.
I think there be six Tudors in the field -
Five have I slain today instead of him.
A horse, a horse - my kingdom for a horse.
