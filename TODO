use target display in learning loop

maybe: include tomorrow's reviews when extending
maybe: non-determinstic display bumping so adjacent lines don't all drop out at once
maybe: vary algorithm for lines that are repeatedly forgotten (slower/non-determinstic ease bumping?)
maybe: drop ease when bumping display (sqrt?)
maybe: replace ease/streak with a pre-determined succession
maybe: more aggressive ease-drop on failure
