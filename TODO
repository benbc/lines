maybe: Use same logic in extending as recordSuccess so we don't extend over lots of lines that will be ignored
maybe: change sort order to go through a scene in order
maybe: non-determinstic display bumping so adjacent lines don't all drop out at once
maybe: vary algorithm for lines that are repeatedly forgotten (slower/non-determinstic ease bumping?)
maybe: replace ease/streak with a pre-determined succession
maybe: more aggressive ease-drop on failure (instead of display drop?)
